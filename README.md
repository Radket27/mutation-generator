# mutation-generator
Simple program to simulate random substitution mutations in nucleotide sequence (sample nucleotide sequence contains only adenine).\
After running the program you can select the probability of random substitution mutations. You can also select length of the nucleotide sequence and number of generations.\
Program returns the number of generations where mutation occurred and also prints the nucleotide sequence.
